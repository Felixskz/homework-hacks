## Use Hyperlink for Instant Trophy Application



Using this link (don't click):

transum.org/Trophies/Apply.asp?ID_Item=blank1&Level=blank2&Other_Text=blank3



Rewrite the blanks:

Blank #:

1. Type of award, every task on Transum has an ID, you have to find the appropriate one for your trophy. (I really don't want to write a list)
2. The level of task, leave blank if there is only one level.
3. Either the text that the task displays on the trophy, e.g: 'Completed', or the score that you want to get for the task.
